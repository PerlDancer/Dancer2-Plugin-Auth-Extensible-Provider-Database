Revision history for Dancer2-Plugin-Auth-Extensible-Provider-Database

0.600 Thu 26 May 18:07:21 CEST 2016

	[ENHANCEMENTS]

    * Add new set_user_details and set_user_password methods.

    [MISC]

    * Split out Dancer2::Plugin::Auth::Extensible::Provider::Database from
      the Dancer2::Plugin::Auth::Extensible distribution.
    * Provider is now a Moo class and has been rehacked to be compatible
      with Plugin2. This means thus provider is not compatible with Dancer2
      releases <= v0.166001.

    For earlier changes please see Dancer2::Plugin::Auth::Extensible's Changes.
